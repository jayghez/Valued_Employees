Human Resources or Human Resource Management in recent decades has transformed from handling legal and financial matters of a business' employees to somewhat of an art. From small to large companies, knowing the how and why of  quality employees is absolutely crucial. The only problem is there isn't one reliable metric or tactic that can predict the success of a new hire.


## Human Resource Dataset 

My project explores a dataset of almost 15,000 employees at Company X. The dataset has information about how long each employee has worked at the company, whether or not they have received promotion in the last 5 years, self reported satisfactions scores, category of position and more in Figure 1 and 2.

From this deeper look into HR data from Company X, I was able to gain deeper insight into how certain employees leave. Fig. 1 demonstrates that between 6 and 10 hours of work per day correlated with a lower leaving percentage. The section of fig. 1 between 4 hours and 6 hours a day of work had a 40-50% of leaving. This percentage goes up to about 80%  as employees worked more than 12 hours. These findings are further collaborated by fig 2., which shows that as most employees crossed the same 12-13 hour boundary, job satisfaction dropped substantially. Self-reported satisfaction indexes do not necessarily imply employees will leave. As noted early, employees that have left are not overly represented by low satisfaction indexes (satisfied leavers were 28% of sample).  The correlations in this data suggest that overworking as well as underworking employees tend to leave.
