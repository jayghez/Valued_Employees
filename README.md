Human Resources or Human Resource Management in recent decades has transformed from handling legal and financial matters of a business' employees to somewhat of an art. From small to large companies, knowing the how and why of  quality employees is absolutely crucial. The only problem is there isn't one reliable metric or tactic that can predict the success of a new hire.


## Human Resource Dataset 

My project explores a dataset of almost 15,000 employees at Company X. The dataset has information about how long each employee has worked at the company, whether or not they have received promotion in the last 5 years, self reported satisfactions scores, category of position and more in Figure 1 and 2.
